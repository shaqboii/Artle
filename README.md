# Artle: A play on Wordle!

<h4>Artle is a variation of the popular puzzle game Wordle, where it differs in the game's solution. Typically, in Wordle, you have to guess the correct word to complete the daily challenge. To aid you, the game will tell indicate if the letters of your guesses are either an exact match, or are somewhere else in the solution word.</h4>
<h4>However, in Artle, you are already given the solution word. The challenge is to match a randomly-generated 5x6 tile art set using words you know to fulfill the tile matches. It will make a lot more sense if you play it and check it out for yourself.</h4>
