# Artle: A play on Wordle!

Artle is a variation of the popular puzzle game Wordle, where it differs in the game's solution. Typically, in Wordle, you have to guess the correct word to complete the daily challenge. To aid you, the game will tell indicate if the letters of your guesses are either an exact match, or are somewhere else in the solution word.
However, in Artle, you are already given the solution word. The challenge is to match a randomly-generated 5x6 tile art set using words you know to fulfill the tile matches. It will make a lot more sense if you play it and check it out for yourself.

Just install the .zip and run main.py. If you're running this in an IDE with a terminal, you will find that the solutions will be posted there in case you get stuck. Also, you will need pygame so be sure to run ```pip install pygame``` in the terminal before running. After that, a GUI will pop up to play. Have fun!

In the gameplay screenshot above, we can see that the player has already correctly guessed 3 words, though they can be any that matches the conventions of the solution word. Now they have to guess a word that matches the 4th row's letter indiciations.
